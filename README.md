# Essential algorithms

This repo is meant to collect essential algorithm problems which I feel engineers should know by heart. The solutions to this problems will be provided and a test suite was created to test attempted solutions.

## How to use

Run the following:

```
npm install
npm test
```

The test suite will run on watch mode. Click the header of a proble to be directed to a file where you can write your solution. If you solve it, the test for that problem will pass.

## [Problem 1: Move Zeroes](p1.js)

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note:** Modify in place without making a copy

**Example 1**

````

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

```

**Example 2**

```

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

```
