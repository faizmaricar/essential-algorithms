# Essential algorithms

This repo is meant to collect essential algorithm problems which I feel engineers should know by heart. The solutions to this problems will be provided and a test suite was created to test attempted solutions.

## How to use

Run the following:

```
npm install
npm test
```

The test suite will run on watch mode. There are a list of problems below. Click on a problem to read the problem statement. In the statement, you can click the header of the problem to be directed to a file where you can write your solution. If you solve it, the test for that problem will pass.
